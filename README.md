# Credit-Card-Approval

This project uses a database from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to build a machine learning model to determine if a credit card application is approved or not. It involves handling of missing values, label encoding of non-numeric data using LabelEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing, training & test splits, scaling data with MinMaxScaler() from sklearn.preprocessing, fitting a logistic regression model to train the set, predicting and evaluating peformance of the model using predict() and the confusion matrix respectively, improving the model with GridSearchCV from sklearn.model_selection. This solution has 85% accuracy.
